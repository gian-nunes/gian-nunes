### Hello! Welcome to my profile

As a student of the Analysis and Systems Development course at Unifil, I am acquiring fundamental technical and theoretical skills to perform in the technology market. Among the skills I have been developing, I highlight object-oriented programming in various languages such as Java, Python, and C#, as well as web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Angular.

In addition to these technical skills, I have intermediate English proficiency, as well as communication and teamwork skills.

My current goal is to seek opportunities in back-end development in Python and GoLang, languages that I have been studying with dedication.

I have a desire to improve my skills and gain experience in a challenging and collaborative environment, as I believe this is the best way to grow and develop professionally. I am committed to contributing to the success of the projects I participate in, using my creativity and dedication to deliver quality solutions.

I am excited about the possibilities for growth in the technology sector and I hope to have the opportunity to add value to your company.
